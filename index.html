    <p>Elephant shrews, also called jumping shrews or sengis, are small insectivorous mammals native to Africa,
        belonging to the family Macroscelididae, in the order Macroscelidea. Their traditional common English name
        "elephant shrew" comes from a perceived resemblance between their long noses and the trunk of an elephant, and
        their superficial similarity with shrews (family Soricidae) in the order Eulipotyphla. However, phylogenetic
        analysis has revealed that elephant shrews are not properly classified with true shrews, but are in fact more
        closely related to elephants than to shrews.[4] In 1997, the biologist Jonathan Kingdon proposed that they
        instead be called "sengis" (singular sengi),[5] a term derived from the Bantu languages of Africa, and in 1998,
        they were classified into the new clade Afrotheria.</p>
